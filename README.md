# Introductory-Links-Blogs

This post contains a List of useful links for learning about neural networks and CNN, with some knowledge on ML, and public datasets to work on

1)	Introductory demo for Neural Networks: https://playground.tensorflow.org 
2)	VLFeat toolbox in Matlab for feature descriptors (red this after 6th PPT set): http://www.vlfeat.org/
3)	Kaggle website hosting DR competition (has data & codes): https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection 
The general website https://www.kaggle.com/competitions also has a list of other competitions for deep learning with datasets freely available.
4)	Analytics Vidhya is a general website for ML-related topics that has interview questions, articles and hackathons: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/ 
A few specific topics that are useful: 
Six probability distributions for data science: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/6-probability-distributions-data-science/
30 Q’s on SVM: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/10/svm-skilltest 
40 Q’s on DL: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/40-questions-test-data-scientist-deep-learning/ 
30 Q’s on logistic regression: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/skilltest-logistic-regression/ 
30 Q’s on decision trees: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/30-questions-test-tree-based-models/ 
40 Q’s on time series: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/40-questions-on-time-series-solution-skillpower-time-series-datafest-2017/ 
5)	Datasets for medical image problems: https://grand-challenge.org/all_challenges/ 
6)	Starter dataset for texture analysis: http://www.ux.uis.no/~tranden/brodatz.html
7)	Deep Learning Book by experts in DL: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ 
Note: Chapter 2 till chapter 9 are most important for a theoretical foundation for DL. Some of the chapters have links to slides also.
8)	Scikit toolbox in Python for Machine Learning: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ 
This has most of the topics in ML as functions. The cheat-sheet on last slide of my 1st lecture is an overview of this.
9)	Keras, a python-based library for DL for beginners: https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/
On the right-side list in this website, it has basic codes for most topics in DL.
10)	Tensorflow, a python-based library for advanced DL: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/ 
It has many links to tutorials.
11)	CS231n Stanford Course on CNN: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/ 
It has the full video lectures: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv
Slides for all the lectures: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html
